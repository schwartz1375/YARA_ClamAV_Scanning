# YARA and ClamAV Scanning
This Docker container and Python script is a malware scanning tool that utilizes YARA and ClamAV to scan files for potential malware. It is designed to be easy to use and extendable for various use cases.

## Features
* YARA Scanning: Utilizes YARA rules to scan files for patterns that indicate potential malware.
* ClamAV Scanning: Uses ClamAV to scan files for known malware signatures.
* Extensible: Easily add more YARA rules or integrate additional scanning tools.
* TBD add ML model
* TBD summary of results

## How to build and run
``` 
docker build -t malware-scanner .
docker run -it -v <local-path>:/app/files --entrypoint /bin/bash malware-scanner
```
Next we need to update ClamAV and start several services
``` 
freshclam
service clamav-daemon start
service clamav-freshclam start
```

## Adding More YARA Rules

The container leverages [YARA Rules](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules), however you can add more YARA rules by placing your .yar or .yara files in the /app/rules directory, and the script will automatically include them in the scanning process.

## Usage 
```
python app.py <file_path>
```
